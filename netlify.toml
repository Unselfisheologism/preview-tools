# Settings for deploying to Netlify

[build]
  # Command to build your site
  command = "npm run build"
  
  # Directory (relative to root of your repo) that contains the deploy-ready
  # HTML files and assets generated by the build command.
  # For `next export` or `output: 'export'`, this is 'out'.
  publish = "out"

[build.environment]
  # Set the Node.js version if needed, e.g., "18" or "20"
  # NODE_VERSION = "20"
  # NPM_VERSION = "10.5.0" # Example specific npm version

# Optional: Redirects and rewrites
# For a Next.js static export, Netlify is usually smart enough to handle
# routing to the correct .html files. A 404 redirect is common.
# [[redirects]]
#  from = "/*"
#  to = "/404.html" # Ensure you have a src/app/404.tsx or similar that generates 404.html
#  status = 404

# If you are building a Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing
# and only one index.html, you might use this:
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/*"
#   to = "/index.html"
#   status = 200
# However, for Next.js static export, this is usually not needed as it generates
# HTML files for each route.
